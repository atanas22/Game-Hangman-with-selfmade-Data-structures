# Game-Hangman-with-selfmade-Datas-tructures
That's console app. - the game "Hangman" . I use my own self made data structures for storing data: SearchTree &lt;- BinaryTree &lt;- AVLTree

* The most appropriate data structure for this project is HashTable for storing data. I used AVL tree because for practice - since it is much harder to make AVLTree than HashTable).
